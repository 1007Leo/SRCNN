# Super-Resolution
Python implementation of Super-Resolution Neural Networks from papers:
* SRCNN - [Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092)
* CARN - [Fast, Accurate, and Lightweight Super-Resolution with Cascading Residual Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08664)
* ESRT - [Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11084)

### Requirements

* python 3.12.3
* pytorch 2.4.1
* cuda 11.8

This is what I used, but some other versions might work too.
